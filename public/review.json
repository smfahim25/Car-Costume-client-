It was a very small inconvenience, but I understand that for people who aren't internet savvy, it's important to give them easy instructions! Your customer service ROCKS! Thank you again for the nice gesture she extended to me. Very grateful anytime I get excellent service these days.",

The parts were suppose to be here and I waited and even paid for the shipping. I called carparts customer service on 3 occasions and help for over 2 hrs. I have 1 screen shot of me just waiting over an hour in attached. What happened was not ok. I still have not got my package.",

I made mention of this in a review of the grill and though it was no fault of their own, they reimbursed me $20 to find hardware locally without me even reaching out to them directly.",

I was disappointed and gave them a 2 rating. They promptly contacted me and apologized for the delay and refunded me the price of the bulb.I appreciate that and upgrading my rating to a 4. I will likely order from them again.",

They also gave me the option of getting a new tailgate. This company is awesome in the fact the day received it I notified them by leaving a review at 10 pm and the contacted me at 9 am the next day. Great customer service will definitely use them again.",

The company reached out to me afterward to try to make it right and better my experience. I was very appreciative of the customer care and how quickly they were responding. That experience alone was enough for me to absolutely recommend this company and to want to return as a customer if ever needed again.",

Aside from my troubles with shipping which I paid for rush, it's taken 5 phone calls, 2 live chats, and a complaint via BBB to process my refund. Mind you, they told me they had processed my refund over 11 days ago and that it would be completed between 24-48 hours.",

Very commendable and unexpected I appreciate that they cared it's a rarity these days THANKS!",
